This Free Non-Exclusive **{{ LICENSE_NAME }}** License Agreement (the "Agreement"), effective as of **{{ CONTRACT_DATE }}** (the "Effective Date"), is entered into by and between **{{ PRODUCT_OWNER_FULLNAME }}** a/k/a **{{ PRODUCER_ALIAS }}** (the "Producer" or "Licensor") and **{{ CUSTOMER_FULLNAME }}**, residing at **{{ CUSTOMER_ADDRESS }}** ("You" or "Licensee"). This Agreement governs your use of the instrumental music file(s) (the "Track"). For clarity, “Track” includes all files comprising the Track, individually and collectively.

This Agreement is issued solely for the Licensee's use of the Track under the terms and conditions set forth below.

## 1. Rights

You may use the Track only for personal, non-commercial purposes. The Track may not be transferred, distributed, resold, or sublicensed. The Producer grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Track solely for personal, non-commercial purposes. You are responsible for ensuring that the Track is lawfully acquired and free from malicious software. All applicable laws and third-party license terms must be followed. Upon termination, your rights to use the Track cease unless a new agreement is executed.

## 2. Term

This Agreement is valid for **{{ TERMS_OF_YEARS }}** years and will expire on the **{{ TERMS_OF_YEARS }}** year anniversary of **{{ CONTRACT_DATE }}**.

If the Effective Date is February 29 and the expiration year is not a leap year, the license expires on February 28 of that year.

## 3. Permitted Uses

The license is granted to a single user. Additional users require separate arrangements.

The Producer grants a limited, non-exclusive, non-commercial, non-transferable license to incorporate the Track into your own music productions. For any commercial usage, a paid license must be purchased.

Licensee may create new compositions (“New Compositions”) or master recordings (“New Masters”) using the Track. The Track may be modified in arrangement, tempo, pitch, or length for inclusion in New Compositions.

Use of New Compositions or New Masters is limited to the purposes specified in this Agreement. Rights remain non-exclusive; the Producer may license the Track to others on similar terms.

The producers of this track are not responsible for clearing any samples used in this track. Licensees are not required to account or pay any royalties, fees, or monies paid to or collected by the Licensee, or which would otherwise be payable to producers in connection with the use/exploitation of the New Composition(s) and/or New Master(s) as set forth in this Agreement.

Any sampling of the track **must** be cleared with the producer.

## 4. Restrictions

Licensee may **NOT**:

- Transfer or assign any rights without prior written consent.

- Register the Track or any part thereof with any content identification service, performing rights organization, music distributor, or digital aggregator.

## 5. Ownership

Producer retains all rights, title, and interest in the Track, including copyrights. Nothing herein transfers ownership to Licensee.

You do not own any New Masters; you own only your original contributions to New Compositions.

Publishing shares of New Compositions may be shared as specified in **{{ PUBLISHING_SHARES }}** to be split among the collaborators on this track.

Subject to all of the terms and restrictions set forth in this Agreement, each party shall be entitled to solely administer their respective share of the New Composition(s).

## 6. Mechanical License

If any portion of the New Song—whether a musical composition, selection, or arrangement—is written, composed, or owned (in whole or in part, alone or with collaborators) by the Producer, or by any entity in which the Producer has a direct or indirect interest, such portion shall be considered a “Controlled Composition.”

The Producer agrees to grant, or cause to be granted, to the Licensee a mechanical license for each Controlled Composition embodied in the New Song. Under this license:

1. For sales in the United States and Canada, the Licensee shall pay mechanical royalties at 100% of the statutory minimum rate, without any cap, including for albums and EPs.

2. For sales outside the United States and Canada, the Licensee shall pay mechanical royalties at the prevailing industry rate in the applicable country at the date this Agreement is executed.

This mechanical license ensures that Licensee may reproduce, distribute, and sell the New Song in physical or digital form in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, while compensating the Producer for any portions of the composition they control.

## 7. Credit

Licensee must give proper credit to the Producers on this track in all applicable New Compositions and Masters in a manner such as: **"Produced by {{ TRACK_CONTRIBUTOR_ALIASES }}"**. Licensee should use best efforts to ensure credit accuracy.
