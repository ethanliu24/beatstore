## Installation

### Stripe
Stripe will handle payments with Stripe Checkout.

1. In the rails project, enter rails credentials editing enviornment using this command:
`VISUAL="cursor --wait" rails credentials:edit`
    - _Instead of "cursor", you can use the command that opens the editor of your choice, e.g. "code"_
    - _Locate the stripe field_
2. Set up Stripe with the project by creating/logging in to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)
3. Copy the public and secret keys to `stripe.<env>.public_key` and `stripe.<env>.secret_key`.
4. Get the payments webhook route signiture and paste to `stripe.<env>.payments_webhook_secret`

The resulting credential file for stripe should look like this:
```
stripe:
  test:
    public_key: <sk_test_...>
    secret_key: <sk_test_...>
    payments_webhook_secret: <whsec_...>
  live:
    public_key: <sk_live_...>
    secret_key: <sk_live_...>
    payments_webhook_secret: <whsec_...>
```

Close the file to save.

Additionally, we need to install the [Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli) to test Stripe webhooks locally.
Run the following command to install it on:
- Mac: `brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe`

### Gems
Install all the gems with bundle:
```
$ bundle install
```

### PostgreSQL
First install Postgresql if haven't yet and create a super user.

Then, create a database called `beatstore` with password `beatstore`. This will be used for development and test.
Follow the steps below to set it up:

```
$ psql  # will enter the enviornment to modify databases, make sure you run as the super user

# do the following
CREATE ROLE beatstore WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'beatstore';
ALTER ROLE beatstore CREATEDB;
\q  # exit enviornment

rails db:setup  # set up dev and test databases for rails
```

Useful commands:
1. `psql -U $(whoami) -d postgres -c "\du"` - Checks all databases you have

### Tabler Icons
Icons are not committed to the repo due to the large amount of it, so newly cloned projects will need to install them. Icons are from [Tabler](https://tabler.io/icons).
```
$ rails generate rails_icons:install --libraries=tabler
```


## Running

### Backend Server

Run this to start the server:
```
$ ./bin/dev
```

The reason we use this instead of `rails s` is so that Tailwind can watch for changes. If not working on views, either command works.

### Stripe CLI
This is for testing Stripe webhooks locally. In a seperate terminal and run the following commands:

1. `stripe login`
    - This will prompt you to go to an url to log in
2. `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/webhooks/stripe/payments`
    - This will output a webhook signiture event in format `whsec_...`
    - Open rails credentials: `VISUAL="cursor --wait" rails credentials:edit`
    - in `stripe.test.payments_webhook_secret`, if the signiture is different, replace it with the newly generated signiture
3. `stripe trigger <webhook-event>`
    - This will trigger a Stripe webhook event and will be picked up by localhost

More details [here](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks/create?endpoint_location=local).


## Testing
To run tests, use the commands below.
```
$ rspec  $ run all tests
$ rspec <directory-or-file>  # run all tests in the given directory or file

# or alternatively, use "bundle exec rspec" instead of rspec
```
